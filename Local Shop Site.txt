VERSION 2.0
TITLE: Small Scale Businesses that manufactures at home can sell to more costomers with the help of our website
DESCRIPTION: For eg there is a  house wife that makes cookies in small packets 20 rupees per packet. She wants to sell these cookeies
but she can't because she can't open a store instead she becomes a member of our website. Then we ship her products to any shop of her 
choice and next the shopkeeper then sells those products as usual. Now the profit made from the sales is divided among the shop keeper and the lady by us.

SUBSCRIPTION PLAN: For the producer 
		1. Levels of subscription depending on quantity, wt, freq and distance
		2. Contract will be set by the producer based on the number of products they want to sell, weight of the total products, when they want to sell within 
		   subscription month, this will be the subscripition amount
		3. A certain amt of subscription is fixed for any seller whether this home producer or shop
